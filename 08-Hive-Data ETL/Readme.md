Apache Hive presents a relational view of data in HDFS. Hive can represent data in a tabular format managed by Hive or just stored in HDFS irrespective in the file format the data is in. Hive can query data from RCFile format, text files, ORC, JSON, parquet, sequence files and many of other formats in a tabular view. Through the use of SQL you can view your data as a table and create queries like you would in an RDBMS.
